## Contents

- **Chapters 1â€“2:** Detailed notes and worked solutions in LyX (.lyx) and PDF formats  
  *Note: Chapters 1 and 2 might not be as detailed as later chapters since they were studied before the creation of this repository.*

- Additional problem sets and assignments as I progress through the book
- Miscellaneous algebra-related thoughts and observations

## Structure

- `chapter1/` â€” Notes and solutions for Chapter 1
- `chapter2/` â€” Notes and solutions for Chapter 2
